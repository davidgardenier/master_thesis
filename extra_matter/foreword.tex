\chapter*{Preface}
Before diving into the body of this thesis, I wish to devote a few brief words to those who were instrumental in helping me through my masters project, whether scientifically or elsewise. Many thanks to Phil for supervising me throughout the year, and also thanks to Lucy for helping me during the first months. I wish to thank Adam too, for being available for occasional questions, as well as Jeroen Hoeman for the illuminating discussion on my results. My gratitude also goes to Peter for helping me to further my programming skills. Furthermore I thank Marieke and Abbie, for their help and their infinite wisdom on life as a student. Last of all I wish to thank my fellow master students, especially Coen and Jakob, for brilliant times and unforgettable experiences I have had at the Anton Pannekoek Institute.\\

I am honoured to have had the company of you all,\\
\hspace*{\linewidth}\hspace*{-1.8cm} \emph{David}\\
